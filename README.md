# 42 Cursus

## FDF ðŸ—º
This is the first graphic project in the 42 School using the minimalistic codam library: [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)  
In this project you will transform a map consisting of numbers (representing the Z axis) and colors (in hexadecimal format) into a 3D wireframe graphic.

It reinforces various programming concepts as file handling, graphics rendering, and user input processing. You learn how to use an external library, reading the documentation and testing it as well as basic mathematical concepts (lineal algebra, trogonometry) and the Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm.
